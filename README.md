# RPG Toolkit Development System; Version 3

I've converted this from CVS -> GIT and moved it over to GitHub, largely for posterity.

The original Sourceforge project is located here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgtoolkit/

I'm keeping this around for personal nostalic reasons.  After the rpgtoolkit was GPL'ed, some variants were forked by volunteers in the community.  The latest one I am aware of is here: https://github.com/rpgtoolkit (I am not involved with it in any way, just as my involvement with RPGToolkit 3 ended after version 3.0.4 or so)

## Final cbm commit
In fact, you can find my last commit in the history, as the old CVS history has been preserved.  I have also tagged it:

~~~~
git checkout cbm_lastcommit

...and the commit history shows:

## Why Keep This Copy in Your Personal Repo?
The RPG Toolkit was my "masterpiece" sideproject when I was in my early 20s and going through university.  I was amazed by the amount of comunity support I got.  As is the case with most personal projects, I just wanted to "scratch an itch", and I was incredibly into videogames at the time.

Top-down 2D RPGs seemed relatively simple to code, and I set about doing the very best I could.  I think I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, considering the development tools I had available to me in the late 90s and early 2000s.

Honestly, if it wasn't for this project, I wouldn't be the software developer I have come to be today.  I developed so much of my early, formative, programming style on this project.

So I wanted this in my personal GitHub, because so much of it is really, personally, mine.

I really appreciate the volunteers who grabbed the torch after I stepped down.  I'm just happy anyone else ever found this useful :)
